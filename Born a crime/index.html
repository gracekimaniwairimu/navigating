	<h1>FEARLESS</h1>
	<p> The most interesting part in Born in crime is Trevor mother,
	  she is a fearless Woman she understood that having a child with
	  a white is a crime, that could take her to jail for four years 
	  but she still broke those rules. She was willing to raise her 
	  Son alone.
	    We are told that when she was young she dint want to live in Soweto
	    and she Ran away to live in downtown Johannesburg, and it was illegal.
      We are also told that there were no white collar jobs for blacks they only 
      had options to work at a farm or to work as maids but Trevor's mother chose to
      take a secretarial course because she despised working in a factory and she 
      was a bad cook.</p>
      <h2>RELIGION</h2>

      <p>  Trevor and his mother cope with poverty and fear of violence surrounding them
       by being religious Trevor's mother was a devout Christian; she took the family to
       three churches every Sunday, which took all day, the reasons they went to different
       churches was because each church had something to offer.
          She seems to believe that the more  church she goes to, the more blessings she will
       get and the more likely she will be to have her prayers answered.Whenever their car could
       not start they used public minibuses. She dedicates countless hours to pray in order to gain
       the sense of control and certainty she lacks.
           In church they used to be told to pray to Jesus to save them but for them they prayed so that
        Jesus would save  from the whites.Trevor's mother restricted her son from watching unreligious videos
       she only allowed her to listen to gospel stuff.</p>

       <h3>RACISM</h3>
        <img src="https://www.afsc.org/sites/default/files/u1752/we-all-belong-here-web.jpg" width="400" height="350"><img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/text-sign-showing-stop-racism-conceptual-photo-end-antagonism-directed-against-someone-different-race-blank-business-167016168.jpg"width="400" height="350"

       <p>   Trevor was born as a colored child a lot of his life and his mother’s is defined by
        negative attitudes about their skin color whenever she went to Soweto those around would
        call her a prostitute because she had a white kid.
             There is racism where Trevor's family thought that when he prays, Jesus will listen to
        his prayers more. His grandmother gave him as much food as he wanted and never disciplined
        him because she didn’t know how to hit a white child, and he becomes famous in Soweto for 
        his light skin.We can also see how Noah was always indoors because if the police saw him they
        would take him to orphanage and arrest his mother.
            There was racism when they wanted to go to the park they would always go with a friend who 
        was white and Trevor's mum would act as the maid to avoid attention and the authority. Also when
        they went to the park with trevor's father he would walk far from them because the whites and black
        were not allowed to  socialize. 
             There was also racism where whites, colored and blacks lived in different places and it was illegal
        to live wherewhites were unless you were working .There were also no white color jobs for blacks.</p>                                                    <h4>LOVE</h4>

        <p>  Trevor and his mother, Patricia, who is fearless grew up together, just the two of them, Noah long
         considers himself and his mother a team. Patricia showed Trevor that many rules were based on nonsense 
         and that he must be careful about breaking them. And when he did break them which he did all the time 
         she punished him harshly. His mother uses pain to show love for example when Trevor is naughty his mum 
         disciplines him then later she  smile to him
            Although Trevor was inseparable from his mother for much of his childhood, they also had a love-hate 
         relationship because Trevor is disobedient and his mother is strict. Like when Noah failed exams her
         mum would strictly ground him for a week from watching television. And Noah would be so rude to her. But later they would joke and laugh together and talk as adults.</p>
